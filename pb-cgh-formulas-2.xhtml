<h3>Hologram</h3>

<p>abstract $\omega t/T - k r_n(h)$ and $\omega t - k p_ʀ(h)$ as $\varphi$
and formulate phase sweep as integral
which yields a simple result based on the phase differences.</p>

<p>cumulative calculation only needs the <u>initial phases</u>
of each object point, because it works with their differences (relative values),
not their absolute values.

So, although the absolute values do cycle over time
(which is what, theoretically, the cumulative calculation is doing:
summing contributions at different moments,
therefore at different absolute phase values),
the fact that they cycle (precisely) <u>in phase</u> with each other,
means that their differences will be constant over time.</p>

<h3>Complex formulation</h3>

<p>
As previously defined, let $h = (h_x; h_y; 0)$ be a pixel on the hologram plane ($z = 0$),
and $p_n = (p_{nx}; p_{ny}; p_{nz})$ be the location of the $n^{th}$ object point light source.
Then the object wavefront at h for all object point light sources is given by:
</p>

\begin{equation}
obj(h) = \sum_n A_n \exp{(i k r_n(h))}
\end{equation}

<p>where $A_n$ is the amplitude of the light source
and $r_n(h) = \sqrt{(h_x - p_{nx})^2 + (h_y - p_{iy})^2 + p_{iz}^2}$
is the euclidean distance between $p_n$ and $h$.</p>

<p>Also let $A_{ref}$ be the amplitude of the planar reference wavefront,
whose direction is given by the normalized vector
$\mathbf{ref} = (ref_x, ref_y, ref_z), |\mathbf{ref}| = 1$.
Then the reference wavefront at $h$ is given by:</p>

\begin{equation}
ref(h) = A_{ref} \exp \left[ i k (\mathbf{ref} \cdot h) \right] = A_{ref} \exp \left[ i k (ref_x h_x  + ref_y h_y ) \right]
\end{equation}

since $h_z = 0$. By modulating the object wavefront with the planar reference wavefront,
the resulting field at each point $h$ of the hologram plane is given by:

\[
E(h) = obj(h) + ref(h)
\]

The respective intensity pattern is given by the magnitude squared

\[
I(h) = |E(h)|^2 = E(h) * E(h)^*
\]
The bipolar intensity method can be derived by expanding the magnitude squared above
\begin{equation}
I(h) = |E(h)|^2 = |obj(h)|^2 + |ref(h)|^2 + 2 Real[obj(h) * ref^*(h)]
\end{equation}
The $|obj(h)|^2$ term represents object point light sources interfering with each other
and can be neglected in computer generated holography.
The $|ref(h)|^2$ term is the reference bias that increases the hologram intensity
and can also not be included.
Finally, the last term contains all the required information
to fully reconstruct the desired image.
In the bipolar intensity formulation the interference pattern
across points $h$ of the hologram plane is thus described by:

\[ \begin{array}{lcl}
I(h) &amp; \propto &amp;  Real[obj(h) * ref^*(h)]\\
 &amp; \propto &amp; Real [ A_{ref} \exp[-i k (ref_x h_x + ref_y h_y)] \sum_n A_n \exp{(i k r_n(h))} ]\\
 &amp; \propto &amp; Real [ A_{ref} \sum_n A_n \exp{[i k ( r_n(h) - (ref_x h_x + ref_y h_y) )]} ]
\end{array} \]

which finally leads to:

\begin{equation}
I(h) \propto A_{ref} \sum_n A_n \cos{[k ( r_n(h) -(ref_x h_x + ref_y h_y) )]}
\label{eq:bipolar}
\end{equation}
