	<h2>About this site</h2>

	<p>These pages host a collection of notes, diagrams and animations
	that I've been developing as aids to my study of holography
	and specifically computer-generated holography (CGH).
	I'm making them publicly available,
	hoping they might help others who are curious about the topic.</p>

	<p>Requirements for previous knowledge
	of mathematics, physics or signal processing
	will be kept as low as possible.
	My goal is to maintain a highly accessible resource
	for the curious layman.</p>

	<p class="note">
		I make no claim of scientific accuracy
		or otherwise correctness of these pages!
		I'm still learning myself :)
	</p>

	<p>The sources for this site are maintained
	on <b><a href="https://github.com/waldyrious/learning-holography">Github</a></b>.
	Feel free to make suggestions or corrections,
	either via issue reports or pull requests.
	Feedback can otherwise be sent to
	&lt;<span class="gray">waldyrious@gmail.com</span>&gt;
	and I'll gladly respond.</p>

	<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
